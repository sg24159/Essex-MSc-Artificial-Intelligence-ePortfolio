The fourth industrial revolution is characterized by the use of technology to meld the physical, digital and biological realms. This level of innovation comes with the promise of improved efficiency and productivity.

I believe that the Boeing 737 Max is a good example of how this promise of computer-aided productivity can lead to a catastrophic interaction between the physical, the digital, and the biological.

In industry 4.0, businesses are serving existing needs with new technology (Schwab, 2016). At Boeing, this came in the form of relying on software to adjust for differences in the flight characteristics of the 737 Max compared to previous models (Palmer, 2020). This software was known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), it stabilizes the aircraft in certain situations by directing the nose down. This was expected to save on costs, by making the new plane fly like the previous models, retraining would not be required (Palmer, 2020). However, the system relied on a single sensor, another cost saving measure. Fatal crashes occurred on two occasions when faulty sensor readings caused MCAS to pitch the plane nose-down, and pilots lacked the training to correct it (Palmer, 2020).

The costs and implications of this cost saving attempt were widespread. Death, first and foremost, but also lawsuits, lost sales and loss of consumer trust (Palmer, 2020). IT systems that have the power to cause a fatal accident, must use redundant inputs and be overseen by properly trained operators.

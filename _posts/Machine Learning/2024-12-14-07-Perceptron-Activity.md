First example demonstrates the implementation of the lecturecast's example in python.
The use of dot product to sum the inputs and weights took a moment to think about, but makes sense.

These activities really helped me understand the basics. I love code examples.

Using the derivative of the sigmoid makes sense, it is largest in the middle, helping undecided neurons learn faster.

Need to think more about why we dot the deltas with the weights. I will need to review the third example again to reach a thorough understanding.

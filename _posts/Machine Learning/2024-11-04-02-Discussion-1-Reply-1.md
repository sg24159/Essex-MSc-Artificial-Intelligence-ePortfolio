The failure caused by outdated interface at Citibank (Stein, 2022) highlights the need for properly designed Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) in Industry 4.0. There are efficiency gains to be made in industry 4.0 by creating HMI systems with the right combination of hardware, software and the latest technology (Ardanza et al., 2019).

A subset of HMI, Human Computer Interfaces (HCI) can be described as having 5 goals: safety, utility, effectiveness, efficiency, and usability. Usability in particular has only become the subject of study relatively recently (Beard-Gunter, Ellis and Found, 2019). With this being the case, I expect there are many more potential cases of failure involving employees faced with outdated technology.

There is another field of technology that has already faced these challenges and found effective solutions, the gaming industry. This field has innovated methods to allow users to self-teach, by providing built-in feedback and analytics to motivates players to stay engaged for long periods of time (Beard-Gunter, Ellis and Found, 2019). These advances could be used to address one of the critical challenges of Industry 4.0, users lacking digital skills (Ghobakhloo, 2018). Retraining the existing employees is desirable, they have a significant advantage over outside hires by already knowing the company’s procedures and norms (Ghobakhloo, 2018).

Another area where the game industry excels is in the extensive use of beta-testing. This approach ensures that issues with user interfaces have a chance to be addressed by the developers (Beard-Gunter, Ellis and Found, 2019). If the software the Citibank employees were using had been properly beta-tested, the failure might not have occurred at all.

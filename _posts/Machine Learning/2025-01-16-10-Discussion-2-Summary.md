title: "10 Discussion 2: Summary: Expanding on the Four Themes"
category: Machine Learning

My initial post posited that the risks and benefits of AI writing can be analysed across 4 main themes; Supporting workflows, skill development, human touch and and data verification. Examples were given for administrative work, academic writing and creative writing. I finished by proposing that these four themes are universally applicable to the analysis of AI writing.

Natali responded with an explanation of AI uses cases supporting special education and neurodivergent individuals. Yuji pointed out that that AI systems have the ability to operate longer and in parallel than humans. Yuji also explained how more experienced users could alleviate some of the concerns I raised in my initial post.

I think special education is a great example of a place where AI touches on 3 of my 4 themes: workflows, skill development, and human touch. Parallel operation is a good example of supporting workflows, and the relating of data verification to user skill development could be an interesting topic with more research.

Both posts elaborated on my provided themes, although neither post specifically addressed them by name. I am pleased that my peers were able to expand on my perspective, but disappointed by the lack of direct supporting or challenging statements towards my four themes.
